<a name="balloon---consuming-linked-data" class="anchor" href="#balloon---consuming-linked-data"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>balloon</strong> - Consuming Linked Data</h1>

<p>A tool-suite for Linked Data consumption. <strong>balloon</strong> aims in offering public services and tools to take advantage of the semantic web with less effort.
The basic motivation is to establish a foundation for Linked Data as a Service (<strong>LDaaS</strong>). </p>

<p><strong>!!! The project is currently under development and will be available soon !!!</strong></p>

<a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h1>

<p>Today’s vision of a common Web of Data is mostly achieved and coined by the Linked Open Data movement. The first wave of this movement transformed silo-based portions of data into a plethora of open accessible and interlinked data sets. The community itself provided guidelines (e.g., 5 ★ Open Data ) as well as open source tools to foster interactions with the Web of data. Harmonization between those data sets has been established at the modeling level with unified description schemes characterizing a formal syntax and common data semantic. Without doubt, Linked Open Data is the de-facto standard to publish and interlink distributed data sets in the Web commonly exposed in SPARQL endpoints. However, a convenient request considering the globally described data set is only possible with strong limitations. <strong>balloon</strong> wants to overcome this issue by providing a large choice of services to simplify utilizing the web of data for your projects. We think that Linked Data tools should be available as a service (<strong>LDaaS</strong>), to avoid high setup and integration costs and data duplication. Therefore all balloon services will be public available and don't need to be installed locally.</p>
