{"name":"Balloon","tagline":"Balloon","body":"**balloon** - Consuming Linked Data\r\n=======\r\nA tool-suite for Linked Data consumption. **balloon** aims in offering public services and tools to take advantage of the semantic web with less effort.\r\nThe basic motivation is to establish a foundation for Linked Data as a Service (**LDaaS**). \r\n\r\n**!!! The project is currently under development and will be available soon !!!**\r\n\r\n#Features\r\n- **balloon Overflight**\r\n\t-\tSPARQL based LOD crawling\r\n\t-\tIndex of basic structural relationships\r\n\t- Bird's-eye view on Linked Data\r\n- **balloon Fusion** \r\n\t- SPARQL query federation service based on equivalence resources\r\n\t- Automatic endpoint discovery\r\n- **balloon Synopsis**\r\n\t- HTML/JavaScript RDF Viewer & Browser\r\n\t- jQuery Plugin \r\n\t-\tAutomatic information enhancement\r\n\t-\tConfigurable Templating\r\n-\t**balloon Commonalities**\r\n\t-\tFinding common (relevant) super types of entities\r\n\t-\tFinding instances for given type\r\n\t-\tFinding related entities based on types and predicates\r\n\r\n#Overview\r\nToday’s vision of a common Web of Data is mostly achieved and coined by the Linked Open Data movement. The first wave of this movement transformed silo-based portions of data into a plethora of open accessible and interlinked data sets. The community itself provided guidelines (e.g., 5 ★ Open Data ) as well as open source tools to foster interactions with the Web of data. Harmonization between those data sets has been established at the modeling level with unified description schemes characterizing a formal syntax and common data semantic. Without doubt, Linked Open Data is the de-facto standard to publish and interlink distributed data sets in the Web commonly exposed in SPARQL endpoints. However, a convenient request considering the globally described data set is only possible with strong limitations. **balloon** wants to overcome this issue by providing a large choice of services to simplify utilizing the web of data for your projects. We think that Linked Data tools should be available as a service (**LDaaS**), to avoid high setup and integration costs and data duplication. Therefore all balloon services will be public available and don't need to be installed locally.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nThis software has been brought to you by the [Chair of Distributed Information Systems (DIMIS)](dimis.fim.uni-passau.de) and [Media Computer Science (MiCS)](http://mics.fim.uni-passau.de/) at the University Passau.
